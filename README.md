Weather data scraping
# Introduction
Through this data scraping task, I  aim to extract data from websites to gather information about weather of a given location. By using Python and accessing itâ€™s web scraping libraries, we can automate the process of collecting data from multiple sources, saving time and effort in manual data collection.
